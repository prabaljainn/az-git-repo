		<h2>Plot</h2>
		<p>
			The family of Harlan Thrombey, a wealthy mystery novelist, attends his 85th birthday party at his Massachusetts mansion. The next morning, Harlan's housekeeper, Fran, discovers him dead with a slit throat. The police believe Harlan died by suicide, but private detective Benoit Blanc is anonymously hired to investigate. Blanc learns that Harlan had strained relationships with his family members, giving several of them possible motives for murder.
		</p>
		<p>
			Unknown to Blanc, Harlan's nurse, Marta Cabrera, believes she injected Harlan with a lethal dose of morphine after mixing up his medications the night after the party. When she could not find the antidote for the overdose, Harlan stopped Marta from phoning for help and, in order to protect Marta's undocumented family from deportation, used his skill at murder plots to concoct a complicated scenario to exonerate Marta of his death. Harlan instructed Marta in detail to create a false alibi and then slit his own throat.
